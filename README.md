# BackLight
BackLight for TV (ESP8266 / Windows C#):
* BackLight (C# client)

This is just a hobby project I built myself for my living room. It is an arduino-based (ESP8266) backlight for my TV. Communication between client and server is done via UDP over wireless LAN.

Hardware:
* TV: The setup (hardware + software) is created for a full-hd (1080P) tv with 65"
* Micro controller: ESP8266 ESP-12E CH340G Wireless WIFI Internet Development Board f√ºr NodeMcu Lua (
* Computer: I use a windows 10 pc (gigabyte brix, attached to my TV via HDMI)
* Led strip: WS2812B (300 LEDs)
* Power supply: DC 5V-24V 2A-80A

Software:
* Windows: Microsoft Visual Studio / C# .net 7.6.2
* ESP8266: Arduino

Of course, you can use my source code and adapt it to your needs. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to write me :-)
