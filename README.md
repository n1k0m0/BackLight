# BackLight
BackLight for TV (ESP8266 / Windows C#):
* BackLight (C# client)
* ESPServer (arduino-based server for LED strip)

This is just a hobby project I build myself for my living room. It is an arduino-based (ESP8266) backlight for my TV.

Some facts:
* The build is created for a full-hd (1080P) tv with 65"
* Micro controller: ESP8266 ESP-12E CH340G Wireless WIFI Internet Development Board f√ºr NodeMcu Lua (
* Led-strip: WS2812B 
* Computer: I use a windows 10 pc (gigabyte brix, attached to my TV via HDMI)

Of course, you can use my source code and adapt it to your needs. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to write me :-)
